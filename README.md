## Architecture

The project is organized into three crates:

- **client** - Terminal client application
- **server** - Multi-threaded chat server
- **shared** - Shared code (message protocol, networking, logging)

## Requirements

- Rust 1.75+ (edition 2024)
- Cargo

## Quick Start

### Local Development

#### Starting the Server

```bash
cargo run --bin server
```

The server will start on `0.0.0.0:8080` by default.

You can use server commands:
```
/help       # Show available commands
/list       # List connected users
/kick USER  # Kick a user
/quit       # Shutdown server
```

#### Server Configuration

Configure the server using environment variables:

```bash
# Custom address and port
CHAT_SERVER_ADDR="127.0.0.1:9000" cargo run --bin server

# Custom max clients
CHAT_SERVER_MAX_CLIENTS="50" cargo run --bin server
```

#### Starting the Client

```bash
cargo run --bin client
```

You'll be prompted to enter:
1. **Server address** (default: `127.0.0.1:8080`)
2. **Username** (default: `Guest`)

Alternatively, you can use environment variables to skip the prompts:

```bash
# Set both server and username
CHAT_SERVER="127.0.0.1:8080" CHAT_USERNAME="Alice" cargo run --bin client

# Set only server (will prompt for username)
CHAT_SERVER="chat.example.com:443" cargo run --bin client

# Set only username (will prompt for server)
CHAT_USERNAME="Bob" cargo run --bin client
```

### Production Deployment

For production deployment with HTTPS/TLS encryption, see:

- **[deploy/digital_ocean/](deploy/digital_ocean/)** - Deploy on Digital Ocean with tmux + Caddy (simplest, interactive)
- **[deploy/docker/](deploy/docker/)** - Docker deployment with automatic HTTPS
- **[deploy/native/](deploy/native/)** - Native systemd deployment on Ubuntu

Each folder contains complete setup scripts and documentation.

## Usage

### Client Commands

Once connected to the server, clients can use the following commands:

- `/help` - Display available commands
- `/quit` - Exit the chat application
- `/list` - List all connected users
- `/dm <USERNAME> <MESSAGE>` - Send a direct message to a specific user
- `/r <MESSAGE>` - Reply to the last user who sent you a DM
- Any other text - Send a message to all connected users

### Server Commands

While the server is running, administrators can use these commands:

- `/help` or `/h` - Display available server commands
- `/list` - Show all currently connected users with count
- `/kick <username>` - Kick a user from the server
- `/quit` or `/q` - Gracefully shutdown the server

### Command History & Autocomplete

Both client and server support advanced input features powered by rustyline:

**Command History:**
- **↑/↓ arrows** - Navigate through previous commands
- **Ctrl+R** - Reverse search through history
- **Persistent** - Up to 1000 commands stored per session

**Tab Completion:**
- **Client:** Type `/` then press `TAB` to see all commands
- **Client:** Type `/dm ` then press `TAB` to autocomplete usernames
- **Server:** Type `/` then press `TAB` to see all server commands
- **Smart filtering** - Only shows matching completions

**Visual Hints:**
- Inline gray text shows possible completions as you type
- Multiple matches display all options

**Example:**
```bash
# Type "/h" and see hint showing "elp"
/h[elp]

# Press TAB to complete
/help

# Type "/dm A" and press TAB to see users starting with A
/dm Alice

# Press ↑ to repeat last command
```

## Features in Detail

### Colorized Logging

All output is color-coded by category:
- **INFO** (Cyan) - General information
- **OK** (Green) - Success messages
- **ERROR** (Red) - Error messages
- **WARN** (Yellow) - Warnings
- **SYSTEM** (Magenta) - User join/leave notifications
- **CHAT** (White) - Chat messages with colored usernames

### Username Colorization

Each username is assigned a consistent color using hash-based selection from 12 vibrant colors. The same username always appears in the same color, making it easy to follow conversations.

### Smart Username Handling

If you try to join with a username that's already taken, the server automatically appends a random 4-digit suffix (e.g., `Alice_1234`).

### Command History & Tab Completion

Powered by `rustyline`, both client and server feature a rich command-line experience:

**Command History Features:**
- **Navigation**: Use ↑/↓ arrow keys to browse through command history
- **Reverse Search**: Press Ctrl+R to search backwards through history
- **Persistent Storage**: Up to 1,000 commands remembered per session
- **Auto-add**: Commands are automatically added to history after execution

**Tab Completion Features:**
- **Command Completion**: Press TAB after typing `/` to see all available commands
- **Username Completion** (Client only): Type `/dm ` and press TAB to autocomplete usernames from connected users
- **Smart Filtering**: Completions filter based on what you've already typed
- **Multiple Matches**: Shows all matching options when ambiguous

**Visual Hints:**
- Inline gray text appears as you type, showing the most likely completion
- Helps you discover commands without referring to documentation

**Implementation Details:**
- Runs in a separate blocking thread to maintain async performance
- Communicates with async runtime via `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels
- Client tracks connected users list for username autocomplete
- Updates dynamically when `/list` command is executed

Example interaction:
```bash
# Type partial command
$ /h
  ↳ [gray hint: "elp" shown]

# Press TAB
$ /help

# Type /dm and TAB to see all users
$ /dm [TAB]
  Alice  Bob  Charlie

# Type first letter and TAB
$ /dm A[TAB]
$ /dm Alice
```

### Auto-Reconnect with Exponential Backoff

If the connection to the server is lost, the client automatically attempts to reconnect with exponential backoff:
- **Initial delay**: 1 second
- **Maximum delay**: 60 seconds
- **Strategy**: Doubles the wait time after each failed attempt (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 32s → 60s)
- **Preservation**: Your username and last DM sender are preserved across reconnections
- **Auto-rejoin**: Automatically rejoins the server with the same username when reconnected

Example reconnection sequence:
```
Disconnected from server
Attempting to reconnect to 127.0.0.1:8080 (attempt 1)...
Reconnection attempt 1 failed: Connection refused. Retrying in 1s...
Attempting to reconnect to 127.0.0.1:8080 (attempt 2)...
Reconnection attempt 2 failed: Connection refused. Retrying in 2s...
...
Attempting to reconnect to 127.0.0.1:8080 (attempt 5)...
Reconnected to server!
Alice has joined the chat
```

### Direct Messaging

Send private messages to specific users:
- **Send a DM**: `/dm <username> <message>` - Send a direct message to a specific user
- **Reply to DM**: `/r <message>` - Quick reply to the last person who sent you a DM
- **Privacy**: The server logs that DMs are happening but doesn't display the message content
- **Validation**: Server validates that the recipient exists before sending

### Security Features

The application implements comprehensive security measures to protect against common network attacks:

#### Input Validation
- **Username Validation**:
  - Maximum length: 32 characters
  - Allowed characters: alphanumeric, underscore, and hyphen only
  - Empty usernames rejected
- **Message Validation**:
  - Maximum message size: 8KB (prevents memory exhaustion)
  - Maximum content length: 1KB per message
  - Empty messages blocked (client and server-side)
  - Integer overflow protection with safe type conversion

#### Rate Limiting
- **Token Bucket Algorithm**: 10 messages per second per connection
- **Auto-refill**: Resets every second
- **Smart Filtering**: Join messages excluded from rate limits
- **User Feedback**: Clients receive "Rate limit exceeded" errors
- **Protection Against**: Spam floods, DoS attacks, message bombing

#### Connection Management
- **Connection Limits**: Configurable max clients (default: 100)
- **Enforcement**: Server rejects new connections when at capacity
- **Atomic Tracking**: Thread-safe connection counting
- **Auto-cleanup**: Connections automatically decremented on disconnect
- **Graceful Handling**: Proper cleanup on all disconnect scenarios

#### Memory Safety
- **Zero `unsafe` Code**: Entire codebase is memory-safe Rust
- **No `.unwrap()` Panics**: All error paths use safe `Result` propagation
- **Bounded Allocations**: All memory allocations are size-limited
- **Overflow Protection**: Integer conversions use `try_from()` for safety

#### Network Security
- **Message Size Limits**: 8KB maximum per message
- **Chunked Protocol**: Supports large messages without blocking
- **Acknowledgment System**: "OK" handshake prevents desynchronization
- **Clean Disconnects**: Explicit connection shutdown before reconnect
- **Backpressure Handling**: Broadcast channel sized for burst traffic

#### Error Handling
- **Validated Inputs**: All user inputs are validated before processing
- **Error Messages**: Clear feedback sent to clients for invalid operations
- **Logging**: Security events logged with warnings
- **Graceful Degradation**: Invalid requests don't crash the server

#### Security Metrics

| Security Feature | Implementation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Max Message Size | 8KB |
| Max Username Length | 32 characters |
| Max Message Content | 1KB |
| Rate Limit | 10 messages/second |
| Connection Limit | Configurable (default: 100) |
| Memory Safety | 100% safe Rust |
| Input Validation | Comprehensive |

**Note**: For production deployment, consider adding TLS encryption, authentication, and E2E encryption for enhanced security.

### Message Protocol

Messages are sent over TCP with a custom chunked protocol that supports:
- Join notifications
- Leave notifications
- Chat messages
- Direct messages
- Username renames
- User list requests
- Error messages
